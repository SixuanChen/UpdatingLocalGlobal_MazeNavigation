# UpdatingLocalGlobal_MazeNavigation

# Introduction
The present study seeks to understand how mental representations may encode uncertainties in a dynamic environment where information on different scales may align or contradict each other and how individuals integrate cues to make decisions.To address this question, we designed a maze navigation experiment in which participants' decisions could be guided by either local cues or a global goal, both of which could be uncertain. Furthermore, the environment was dynamic, with cue validities varying during navigation. We defined \emph{local} probability as the uncertainty related to events that are physically or temporally proximate, with immediate and direct feedback.\emph{Global}  probability, on the other hand, refers to uncertainty related to events associated with the general objective, requiring a sequence of actions where feedback is distant in space and time.
There are two versions of this experiment.
