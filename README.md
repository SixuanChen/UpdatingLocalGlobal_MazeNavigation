# UpdatingLocalGlobal_MazeNavigation

# Introduction
You are an explorer who needs to navigate inside this maze. When the task begins, your position will be marked as a green square. The walls of the maze will be hidden from you. To move in the maze you will use the arrow keys. At each choice point the choices available to you (that is those not blocked by hidden walls) will be shown to you by small colored circles. To help you track your progress you will be given feedback after most of your choices to let you know if you are heading in the right direction or not. Please use as few steps as possible to find the exit.
