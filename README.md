# Introduction
The present study seeks to understand how mental representations may encode uncertainties in a dynamic environment where information on different scales may align or contradict each other and how individuals integrate cues to make decisions.To address this question, we designed a maze navigation experiment in which participants' decisions could be guided by either local cues or a global goal, both of which could be uncertain. Furthermore, the environment was dynamic, with cue validities varying during navigation. We defined local probability as the uncertainty related to events that are physically or temporally proximate, with immediate and direct feedback.Global probability, on the other hand, refers to uncertainty related to events associated with the general objective, requiring a sequence of actions where feedback is distant in space and time.
